        <p>
          Paris is renowned for its historical libraries, and the
          Bibliothèque nationale de France is often cited as one of the
          most inspiring places to study.
        </p>

        <p>
          During my visit to the Salle Ovale at BnF Richelieu, I wanted to
          understand whether the space truly enhances focus or whether
          the hype outweighs the experience.
        </p>

        <p>
          I spent several hours working on mathematics and computer
          science coursework, surrounded by students immersed in their
          own disciplines.
